## What is MulCommerce?

MulCommerce is my primary portfolio project built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and more. This feature-rich project clearly depicts the depth to which I have explored these technologies. I am also committed to keeping this project up-to-date with the best practices I learn in my day-to-day development life.

I especially thank [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/laravel-multi-vendor-ecommerce-project/) for providing me with ideas on which features to build.
